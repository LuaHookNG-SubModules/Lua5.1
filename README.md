# Diesel Engine compatible Lua5.1

This is a C++ified Lua5.1 with patches added that make it consistent with the features that were hacked into the version that exists within OVERKILL's version of the Diesel engine (as opposed to the one that turned into BitSquid/Autodesk Stingray and moved to LuaJIT)
